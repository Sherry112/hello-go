# My First Golang Project

Welcome to my first Golang project! This project is a simple web application written in Go that demonstrates handling HTTP requests and serving static files.

## Overview

The main functionality of this project includes:
- Serving static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Handling HTTP GET and POST requests.
- Parsing form data from POST requests.

## File Structure

The project structure is as follows:
- `main.go`: This file contains the main Golang code for the web server.
- `static/`: This directory contains static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) served by the web server.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sherry112/hello-go.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hello-go
4. Build & Run the Golang application:
   ```bash
   go build
   go run main.go
6. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to view the application.

## Usage

The root URL http://localhost:8080 serves the static files located in the static/ directory.
The /form endpoint handles HTTP POST requests and parses form data.
The /hello endpoint returns a simple "HELLO GO!" message for HTTP GET requests.
